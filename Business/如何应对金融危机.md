## 在下一次金融危机中你将通过何种方式使你的财富保持增长
*作者：Laurent Bernut*

我是一名于机构内任职的空头投资人。希望您会欣赏以下另类的观点。
经常与我一起划船的一位Fidelity（我所供职的投资机构）首席信息官，这是一个非常随性的家伙，有次他在喝醉酒之后跟我说：“你会是我在金融末日时最想要立刻联系上的两个人之一”，“好吧”，我问他另一个认是谁，“沃伦巴菲特”，他答道。这就是我，一个适合在高压下的海底生存的“深海生物”，一旦上浮到浅水域，我可能会直接膨胀炸掉。

流动性是在熊市中唯一的“法定货币”
这是一直以来都被严重低估了的极其重要的事实之一（好吧，严谨一些）。一些缺德的金融经理人会在熊市中忽悠你去买一些缺乏流动性的垃圾，并美其名曰为“保值”。简直是扯淡。
你恨不得自己的流动性要像你在印度街头连续吃了两周“干净又卫生”的街边小吃后的肠胃一样的顺畅，懂我的意思了么？
你的机会将一泻千里，你想不理都不行。
金融危机到来的时候为了躲避风险，巨富的迪拜阔少们把豪车扔在路边，转身钻进身后的私人飞机里一溜烟地都飞到伦敦乡下找爹妈住去了，这时候的你可以用低到发指的价格收下这些精品车况的法拉利。

现金是女王，自信放光芒
不能出手卖掉的资产就是废纸，是垃圾。要是不信，那就去买游艇，买别墅，买大平层，买猛男粉法拉利，然后试试看你能不能把他们卖掉。只能说希望他祖坟上的青烟够浓吧🤣。
一切为了流动性，从现在开始从任何缺乏流动性的投资项目中撤资。好好查查你买的私募基金细则，它们可是经常在其中藏着在亏损时强制你补仓的条款，在你的账面现金不够补它们在投资生意上捅的大篓子的时候他们立刻就会来找上你，让你补仓。
虽然说我是一个交易员，但我们偶尔也会炒房，但是我们会快速的将这部分投资的收益转化为现金形式（以及其中的一部分会转化为合算的外汇资金）。
